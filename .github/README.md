# Jake Moss - Public Repo
This is a place for things I make and want to share. It *should not* included anything that would be considered academic misconduct. If you find something that you think is, let me know and I'll take it down.

## Errors

If you find an error anywhere other than assessment pieces I'll correct it.

## LaTeX stuff

If you're going to nick my documents you'll need my preamble and environments files. If the document you are trying to steal has Tikz in it you may also need the `tikzpaper` folder. I use a program called `TikZit` to make tikz diagrams using a GUI. It's the worst program I've ever used.

## Versioning and my dumb tags

I will version releases under the course code, **not** the actual version. I may place the version in the title instead if I think having access to previous versions is important.

## Pull requests

The template I'm using has a place for pull requests. Ngl I don't know that they are so I'll decline them?

## Expectations

Set them low. 

## The `.github` folder.

Because of how I have set up this repo I need to put the `README.md` in the `.github` folder to make sure it doesn't interfere with my other `README.md` I use for my private repo. (Hint they literally operate out of the same root folder and this repo has a bunch of ignore conditions)
